# How To Study

Jump straight into `/templates/studies/readme.md` and follow the steps described there.


## Sports
---

For studying faster, keep focus and remind the materials in a deeper way, it is very important to do sports.
If sport is not a beloved activity, just take a walk outdoors every day.


## Setup
---

It is essential to create an atmosphere were you can focus deeply.
Put a bottle of water beside you, tidy up your desk.
Start only the devices and apps you need for studying.
Turn off all notifications (including vibrations) of any device - lay your phone with the display showing down at a place outside of your viewport.

Enjoy studying.


## Studying
---

A good amount of time to study for one day is around about 4h.
You can push it up to maximum 6h per day, but long term it is not worth it.

It is important, to consume the materials fast.
Your notes don't have to be rather beautiful or complete.
This is very important, because of this you miss things and you don't understand topics.
Because of that, you will start to ask and answer questions - and asking a lot of questions is the most efficient learning you can get at all.
