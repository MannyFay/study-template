# Ahmni Setup

This is how to set up Ahmni for studying.

#### Steps
The steps are following iterations by the steps "Retrieve -> Encode -> Retrieve -> Encode".

1. **Retrieve**
	- Pre Test
		- Pass your syllabus through an AI (GPT or Claude), and insert the prompt:
			- "Here is my syllabus. Create 20 questions across the whole content of it by a high overview.".
		- You will fail, because you don't know nothing. Just try your best. This prepares your brain about the topic and trains it, for what to look for.
2. **Encode**
	- Consume Material
		- Look/read materials fast & draw on Ahmni canvas.
		- Ask questions to an AI.
		- Brings you a high level understanding (it wouldn't be detailed and correct at this point).
3. **Retrieve**
	- Teach the topic from 2. to imaginary students.
	- Try to draw the model again, but without looking on the material of step 2.
	- You will run into problems and questions. Mark the problems and write down the questions with a red pen.
4. **Encode**
	- Solve the problems and answer the questions of 3.
	- Update the model of 3. with the new information.

Between the whole topic iterations, do `-> Self Regulation ->`. That is a short review what went good/wrong - maybe go back and refine.
